# Walmart-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-Kaggle-Dataset

The analysis of the Walmart sales dataset revealed clear patterns in store performance, seasonal trends, and external economic influences. Sales peaked in 2011 and were strongly affected by holidays, temperature changes, and fuel prices. Store-wise comparison highlighted significant performance differences, helping identify high- and low-performing stores. Economic indicators like CPI and unemployment showed a noticeable impact on customer spending. Overall, the interactive dashboard provides valuable insights that can support data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies and operational planning.

I created a fully interactive dashboard that helps understand:
  - Yearly and monthly sales trends
  - Store-wise total weekly sales
  - Holiday vs non-holiday performance
  - Impact of temperature and fuel price on sales
  - Relationship between unemployment and weekly sales
  - CPI trend across years
  - Dynamic filtering using slicers
